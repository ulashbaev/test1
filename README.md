## 1. Introduction
Purpose of the Report:  
The purpose of this report is to document the testing process for the car manufacturing website. This website provides users with detailed information about various car models, including specifications, features, pricing, and dealership locations.

Overview of the System Under Test:  
The car manufacturing website is a platform that allows users to explore different car models, customize their options, and locate nearby dealerships.

## 2. Testing Objectives
Description of Testing Goals:  
The goal of testing is to ensure that the features of the car manufacturing website meet user expectations and acceptance criteria provided.

Acceptance Criteria Overview:
1. Model Exploration: Users should explore various car models with detailed specifications.
2. Customization Options: Each car model should allow for customization of features such as color, engine type, and interior options.
3. Pricing Information: Users should view accurate pricing for different configurations.
4. Dealership Locator: The system should provide tools for finding nearby dealerships based on user location.

## 3. Test Design Techniques
List of Proposed Testing Techniques:
- Equivalence Partitioning: Test different ranges of inputs like model types and feature options.
- Boundary Value Analysis: Test at the edges of input criteria, such as minimum and maximum price ranges.
- Exploratory Testing: Explore the system without predefined test cases.
- Usability Testing: Check if users can easily navigate and understand car details and customization options.

Rationale for Each Technique:
- Equivalence Partitioning: Ensures comprehensive coverage by testing representative values.
- Boundary Value Analysis: Identifies edge cases to ensure system stability.
- Exploratory Testing: Discovers unexpected issues by simulating real user behavior.
- Usability Testing: Ensures user satisfaction and ease of use.
